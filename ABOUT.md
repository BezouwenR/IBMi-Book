# About This Book


## TLDR;
This is a collection of notes for curious developers to start learning how to program on the IBMi.


## What is this book?
This "book" is an attempt to coherently organize the various notes I've taken while learning the IBMi. The hardest part about trying to learn the IBMi is
figuring out where to start. I'm not a very smart person, so I had a lot of trouble trying to find a good beginner friendly guide to anything. 
The primary goal of this book is to teach enough information to feel somewhat comfortable programming and navigating the IBMi.

The IBMi is very intimidating to someone with a more modern programming background. Understandably, a lot of people take one look at the green screen
and immediately write it off. I think more people would enjoy learning it if there was a better place to start. I think that the IBMi will still be around for awhile and there will be a growing need for IBMi developers as time goes on. 
Additionally, learning how to program in completely foreign territory will make learning other programming languages/systems much easier.


## Prerequisites
Its assumed that the reader is knowledgable about basic programming in multiple languages.



## The Most Valuable Advice
**"Just keep drinking the IBMi Kool-Aid." - [Ryan Eberly](https://github.com/ryaneberly)**

I didn't realize it at first, but this was the most helpful advice for learning the IBMi.
A lot of the terminology and concepts didn't sink in immediately. 
Its important to stumble around and fall a bunch, its part of the learning process.
