# Introduction to Commands

Commands are kind of just a thin wrapper over a compiled program.
They seem to be underused by many, but its still a worthwhile tool to have in the toolbox.


You can create your own commands (**CMD**s) which can be invoked using the syntax ```MyCmd```.
Making a CMD offers some benefits:
* Parameter type and bound enforcing.
* Intuitive prompting with **F4** parameter labels.
* Can be used with ILE languages (CL, RPGLE, C, etc.)


For practice, we are going to build a small CL with a simple CMD over top of it.


## Example CL
For this example, the CL will take in 3 parameters (a string and two numbers).
The program will output the string, the numbers, and the results of operations using the numbers.
