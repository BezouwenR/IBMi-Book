# Small CL Project

The best way to learn CL is getting your hands dirty.
We will be building the classic Fizzbuzz program to demonstrate CL concepts.


## Commands
Before starting into the CL, to call the program we're going to use a command.
Using a command interface enforces parameter types to the program its connected to.
It also cuts down on the amount of parameter validation code that has to be written.
* ```CRTSRCPF```
* Create CMD source member, compile
* ```CRTCMD```

## CL Source Physical File

To start, enter the command ```WRKOBJPDM YOURLIB```

In order to start writing CL programs, you need to make sure you have a CL source physical file (QCLLESRC).
In the previous chapter a CL source physical file was created while learning about SEU.
If you don't have it, please revisit that section.


## CL Source Member

Enter the command ```WRKMBRPDM YOURLIB/QCLLESRC```.


To create a new CL source member press **F6**
and populate the prompt as shown.

Press enter and you are brought to SEU.
