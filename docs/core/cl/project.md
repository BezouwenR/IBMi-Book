# Small CL Project

The best way to learn CL is getting your hands dirty.
We will be building the classic Fizzbuzz program to demonstrate CL concepts.


## Commands
Before starting into the CL, to call the program we're going to use a command.
Using a command interface enforces parameter types to the program its connected to.
It also cuts down on the amount of parameter validation code that has to be written.
* ```CRTSRCPF```
* Create CMD source member, compile
* ```CRTCMD```
