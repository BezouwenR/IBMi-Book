## Introduction to the 5250 Emulator

This is an emulator of the IBM 5250 terminal originally used to interact with the IBMi and its ancestors. A bit more information on it here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_5250

There's a lot of features in this emulator that I haven't messed around with.

One important thing I learned is using the **popup keypad** located in **Actions** > **Popup Keypad...**
Sometimes when things go wrong, you have to use **SysReq** to bail yourself out (more on this later).
