# Introduction to IBM i


IBM i is a different kind of beast to learn compared to the typical progamming environment. 
In order to get started with programming on IBM i, I think its important to have a basic understanding of what it is.

## IBM i
IBM i is considered a **midrange server**, its not quite a mainframe and not quite an entry-level server. 
This operating system specializes in business applications, reporting, data warehousing, and more. 
It is also well known for its minimal downtime and strong defenses; 
making it the perfect platform for companies housing financial information.

I will cover more important/interesting information about how IBM i came to be and why its still around in the [history](history.md) section.


## Language Overview
There are quite a few languages native to IBM i, I will be primarily covering
* CL
* RPG
* DB2 SQL
* DDS/DSPF (More of a data format than a language)


Additionally, more languages such as COBOL, REXX, C/C++, Python, Java, PHP, and NodeJS can be used through various means.
I will include some basic information and example programs in my [Other Languages](../other/) section.


## Important Note
I will reiterate that this will not be a full blown guide because I myself 
don't know everything about the OS.
But, I will provide some basics to get moving in this new ecosystem.

Some of the concepts don't start to make complete sense until you've messed around
in CL, DB2 SQL, and RPG. So if the concepts don't make sense at first, don't worry.
