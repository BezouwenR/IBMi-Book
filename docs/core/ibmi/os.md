# IBMi OS Concepts

This section is probably not going to make sense for quite a bit of time.
It would be a good idea to revisit this page multiple times throughout the book.

## Definitions
* **Object** - Anything on the IBMi that is named.
* **Object Type** - Dictates how the object will be used.
* **Job** - An action performed on the system. Ex: Compiling/running a program (more on this later)
* **User Profile** - A user's authority and user specific values
* **Library** - Collection of objects (like a directory in Windows/Linux)
* **Library List** - A lookup list for finding objects within libraries. (more on this later)
* **Control Language (CL)** - IBMi command language (like Bash or Windows Batch)

adding more soon...
