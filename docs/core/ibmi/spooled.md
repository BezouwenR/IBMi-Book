## Control Commands
A lot of the time, viewing a spooled file is really annoying because
you have to keep moving left and right due to the screen constraints.

There are a few commands that will make things easier to read.
Input commands in the **Control** field at the top of the screen.

| Command | Description                           |
| ------- | ------------------------------------- |
| T       | Top of file                           |
| B       | Bottom of file                        |
| n       | (number) put n lines at top of screen |
| Pn      | (Page number) go to page n            |
| Wn      | Put n columns on left side of screen  |
| W+n     | Move screen right n times             |
| W-n     | Move screen left n times              |
