# Introduction to RPGLE Fixed


I will preface this with the fact that I haven't really done much RPGLE fixed format programming.
In this section I will do a little bit of fully fixed format, but I'll mostly focus on a mix of free and fixed formats.
In a bonus section, I will mess around with a little bit of legacy **RPG/400 (RPG III)**.


In my opinion, I think its important to learn how to read fixed-format, but by no means would I suggest learning to write it. The majority of learning should be done with writing RPGLE in fully free format.
