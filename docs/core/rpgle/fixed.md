# Introduction to RPGLE Fixed


I will preface this with the fact that I haven't really done much RPGLE fixed format programming.
In this section I will do a little bit of fully fixed format, but I'll mostly focus on a mix of free and fixed formats.
In a bonus section, I will mess around with a little bit of legacy **RPG II, RPG III, and RPG/400**.


Fixed format RPGLE is a little scary to look at at first, but having a brief background on RPRGLE free format will make it seem not so bad.
Honestly, the most valuable part of learning a bit of fixed format RPGLE is for improved google searches.
There is a ton of material on IBM's documentation and other websites that is mostly fixed format.
With a background in fixed format RPGLE, you could more easily understand and convert example programs to free format.

If you know you are going to be working with an existing codebase, this section is a necessity and additional reading should be done online.
I highly doubt I am going to cover enough material on fixed format to be super useful/
