# About This Book


## What is this?
This "book" is an attempt to coherently organize the various notes I've taken while learning IBM i. The hardest part about trying to learn IBM i is figuring out where to start. 
I'm not a very smart person, so I had a lot of trouble trying to find a good beginner friendly guide to anything.
**This is by no means a complete A-Z guide to IBM i, I am not that knowledgable**.


## Why?
The primary goal of this book is to give enough information to feel somewhat comfortable programming and navigating IBM i.
IBM i is very intimidating to someone with a more modern programming background. Understandably, a lot of people take one look at the green screen and immediately write it off. 
I think more people would enjoy learning it if there was a better place to start. I think that IBM i will still be around for awhile and there will be a growing need for IBM i developers as time goes on. 
Additionally, learning how to program in completely foreign territory will make learning other programming languages/systems much easier.


## The Most Valuable Advice
**"Just keep drinking the IBM i Kool-Aid." - [Ryan Eberly](https://github.com/ryaneberly)**

I didn't realize it at first, but this was the most helpful advice for learning IBM i.
A lot of the terminology and concepts didn't sink in immediately. 
Its important to stumble around and fall a bunch, its part of the learning process.


## Who Are You?
I'm a software developer who wants to learn everything related to programming.
**I am by no means an IBM i expert, I'm barely a novice.**
I was lucky enough to score my first job writing Java/ColdFusion/Angular that interfaces with IBM i.
After about 6 months of messing around in my free time and learning the basics, I was promoted to half web developer and half IBM i. 
This is a very cool position because you get to help bridge the gap between generations of programming languages and paradigms.


## Special Thanks
Without the support and encouragement of my coworkers, I don't think I would have continued learning or written this book. Thank you.
