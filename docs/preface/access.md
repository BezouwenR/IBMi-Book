# IBMi Access and Software

This book relies on having access to an IBMi running V7R3+. 
At my current workplace I was lucky enough to be given access to the IBMi. Otherwise, this book would have never been made.
Unfortunately, I believe it is getting harder to find sites to get IBMi access.


## Timeshares
Timeshares will allow you to connect remotely to an IBMi system.
* http://www.pub400.com/
* http://www.rikascom.net/
* http://www.timeshare400.com/
Unfortunately, timeshare sites tend to be full and the system you use will not be updated to the current OS.


## Software
* IBM Access Client Solutions - http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1010355
* ILE Editor - https://github.com/worksofbarry/ILEditor
* I am casually working on an IBMi Visual Studio Code extension, but no estimation on when that will be finished.
