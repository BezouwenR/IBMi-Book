# Before You Read

## Expectations
I am not an encyclopedia of IBM i knowledge. The more I learn about the IBM i, the less I feel like I know. I'm not a very smart person so **this could very well be the blind leading the blind**. Hopefully, this book has enough information to understand IBM i a little bit.


## This is a WIP
I expect to keep adding content to this "book" as I learn more.
More than likely, new content will be included in the **additional** section.


## Requirements
* Ability to program in multiple languages and learn from example.
* Access to IBM i **V7R3+** (sorry I don't have experience in previous OS versions)
* The hunger to learn


## IBM i? AS/400? iSeries?
IBM i has come by many names (AS/400, IBM System i, iSeries). In this book for the sake of simplicity I will be referring to the IBM System i
as IBM i. Since you could be using different hardware, using IBM i would be the most generic term.


## Source Code
All of the code will be embedded in this book. As far as additional source goes, 
I just have a huge dump of source code in an IBM i folder structure here https://github.com/barrettotte/IBM-RPG .
This may or may not include all of the source listed in this book since its kind of just my dumping ground for code/notes.


Snippets will be provided in this format:
```php
       /free
       dsply ('Hello World');
	   *inlr = *on
```


## Don't Buy an AS/400 (Without Basic Research)
So, when I first got curious about IBM i. I naively impulse bought an AS/400 off eBay and it was a mistake. Through basic googling you could figure out pretty quickly that
you need an OS to really use the AS/400; That OS is around $20K. Needless to say, my AS/400 is now a 500lb bar table in the basement. Maybe one day I'll put AIX or a linux distro on it, but for now I can't look my AS/400 in the eyes without feeling embarassed.
