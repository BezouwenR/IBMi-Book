# Before You Read

## Expectations
I am not an encyclopedia of IBM i knowledge. 
The more I learn about the IBM i, the less I feel like I know. 
I'm not a very smart person so **this could very well be the blind leading the blind**. 
Hopefully, this book has enough information to understand IBM i enough to understand the fundamentals.


## This is a WIP
I expect to keep adding content to this "book" as I learn more.
For better or worse, I am a human being and will only really work on this book as I feel like it.
More than likely, new content will be included in the **additional** section.


## Requirements
* Ability to program in multiple languages and learn from example.
* Access to IBM i **V7R3+**.
* Interest in learning older programming languages.
* The hunger to learn.


## Source Code
All of the code will be embedded in this book.
I will also include all of the source separate in https://github.com/barrettotte/IBMi-Book/tree/master/src .

Snippets will be provided in this format:
```php
       /free
       dsply ('Hello World');
	   *inlr = *on
```


## Don't Buy an AS/400 (Without Basic Research)
When I first got curious about IBM i, I naively impulse bought an AS/400 off eBay and it was a mistake. 
Through basic googling you could figure out pretty quickly that you need an OS to really use the AS/400; That OS is around $20K. 
Needless to say, I now have a 500lb bar table in the basement. 
Maybe one day I'll put AIX or a linux distro on it, but for now I can't look my AS/400 in the eyes without feeling embarassed.
