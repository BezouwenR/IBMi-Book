# Introduction to IBMi


The IBMi is a different kind of beast to program on when compared to Windows and *nix machines. In order to get started with programming 
on the IBMi, I think its important to have a basic understanding of what it is.

## The IBMi
The IBMi is considered a **midrange server**, its not quite a mainframe and not quite an entry-level server. 
The IBMi specializes in business applications, reporting, data warehousing, and more. This server is well known for
its minimal downtime and strong defenses; making it the perfect platform for companies housing financial information.

I will cover more important/interesting information about how the IBMi came to be and why its still around in the [history](history.md) section.


## Language Overview
There are quite a few languages native to the IBMi, I will be primarily covering
* CL
* RPG
* DB2 SQL
* DDS/DSPF (More of a data format than a language)

Additionally, more languages such as COBOL, REXX, C/C++, Python, Java, PHP, and NodeJS can be used through various means.
I will include some information and example programs in my [Other Languages](../other/) section.
