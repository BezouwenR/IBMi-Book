# About This Book


## What is this?
This "book" is an attempt to coherently organize the various notes I've taken while learning the IBMi. The hardest part about trying to learn the IBMi is
figuring out where to start. I'm not a very smart person, so I had a lot of trouble trying to find a good beginner friendly guide to anything.
**This is by no means a complete A-Z guide to the IBMi**.


## Why?
The primary goal of this book is to teach enough information to feel somewhat comfortable programming and navigating the IBMi.
The IBMi is very intimidating to someone with a more modern programming background. Understandably, a lot of people take one look at the green screen
and immediately write it off. I think more people would enjoy learning it if there was a better place to start. I think that the IBMi will still be around for awhile and there will be a growing need for IBMi developers as time goes on. 
Additionally, learning how to program in completely foreign territory will make learning other programming languages/systems much easier.


## Requirements
* Ability to program in multiple languages and learn from example.
* Access to an IBMi system with OS **V7R3+**


## The Most Valuable Advice
**"Just keep drinking the IBMi Kool-Aid." - [Ryan Eberly](https://github.com/ryaneberly)**

I didn't realize it at first, but this was the most helpful advice for learning the IBMi.
A lot of the terminology and concepts didn't sink in immediately. 
Its important to stumble around and fall a bunch, its part of the learning process.


## Who Are You?
I'm a software developer who wants to learn everything related to programming.
**I am by no means an IBMi expert, I'm barely a novice.**
I was lucky enough to score my first job writing Java/ColdFusion that interfaces with the IBMi.
After awhile, I got tired of the IBMi being a "black box". So, I decided to build some windows and lights.
With the help of my coworkers, I was given the opportunity and support to learn the basics of the IBMi.


## Source Code
I just have a huge dump of source code in an IBMi-like folder structure here https://github.com/barrettotte/IBM-RPG .
If for some reason you wanted to see it as a file instead of code embedded on a page.


## Special Thanks
Without the support and encouragement of my coworkers, I don't think I would have continued learning or written this book. Thank you.
