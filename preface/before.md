# Before You Read

## Expectations
As stated above, I am not an encyclopedia of IBMi knowledge. The more I learn about the IBMi, the less I feel like I know. I'm not a very smart person so **this could very well be the blind leading the blind**. But, hopefully this book has enough information to understand the IBMi a little bit.


## Requirements
* Ability to program in multiple languages and learn from example.
* Access to an IBMi system with OS **V7R3+** (sorry I don't have experience in previous OS versions)
* The hunger to learn


## Source Code
All of the code will be embedded on the pages of this book in a readable format. As far as source goes, 
I just have a huge dump of source code in an IBMi-like folder structure here https://github.com/barrettotte/IBM-RPG .


## Don't Buy an AS400 (Without Basic Research)
So, when I first got curious about the IBMi. I naively impulse bought an AS400 off eBay and it was a mistake. Through basic googling you could figure out pretty quickly that
you need an OS to really use the AS400; That OS is around $20K. Needless to say, my AS400 is now a 500lb bar table in the basement. Maybe one day I'll put AIX or a linux distro on it, but for now I can't look my AS400 in the eyes without feeling embarassed.
