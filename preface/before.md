# Before You Read

## Expectations
As stated above, I am not an encyclopedia of IBMi knowledge. The more I learn about the IBMi, the less I feel like I know. I'm not a very smart person so **this could very well be the blind leading the blind**. But, hopefully this book has enough information to understand the IBMi a little bit.


## This is a WIP
I expect to keep adding content to this "book" as I learn more content.


## Requirements
* Ability to program in multiple languages and learn from example.
* Access to an IBMi system with OS **V7R3+** (sorry I don't have experience in previous OS versions)
* The hunger to learn


## IBMi? AS/400? iSeries?
The IBMi has come by many names (AS/400, IBM System i, iSeries). In this book for the sake of simplicity I will be referring to the IBM System i
as the IBMi. I know this is technically not correct, since the IBMi is an operating system. However, I will only be using the IBMi OS for this
book, so it makes sense to just call it that. 


## Source Code
All of the code will be embedded on the pages of this book in the appropriate format. As far as source goes, 
I just have a huge dump of source code in an IBMi-like folder structure here https://github.com/barrettotte/IBM-RPG .
This may or may not include all of the source listed in this book since its kind of just my dumping ground for code/notes.


## Don't Buy an AS/400 (Without Basic Research)
So, when I first got curious about the IBMi. I naively impulse bought an AS/400 off eBay and it was a mistake. Through basic googling you could figure out pretty quickly that
you need an OS to really use the AS/400; That OS is around $20K. Needless to say, my AS/400 is now a 500lb bar table in the basement. Maybe one day I'll put AIX or a linux distro on it, but for now I can't look my AS/400 in the eyes without feeling embarassed.
